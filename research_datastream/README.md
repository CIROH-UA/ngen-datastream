# NextGen Framework Research Datastream 
The Research DataStream is an array of daily NextGen executions in the AWS cloud. An exciting aspect of the Research DataStream is the NextGen configuration is open-sourced and community editable, which allows any member of the hydrologic community to contribute to improving forecasts. By making the NextGen forcings, outputs, and configuration publicly available, it is now possible to leverage regional expertise and incrementally improve hydrologic forecasts made with the NextGen Framework. 

Now generating daily NextGen data! -> https://datastream.ciroh.org/index.html
