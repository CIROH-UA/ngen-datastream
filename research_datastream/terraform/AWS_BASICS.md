# AWS Basics

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform that provides on-demand access to a wide range of resources and services, such as virtual machines, storage, databases, and more. AWS is widely used to build scalable and flexible infrastructure without the need to manage physical hardware. This document introduces AWS services relevant to this project, which include workflow orchestration, serverless computing, storage, and identity management.  


## Key AWS Services for This Infrastructure

This project leverages several core AWS services to build and manage cloud infrastructure. Below is an overview of each:

### 1. **AWS Step Functions (State Machines)**
AWS Step Functions enable you to coordinate multiple AWS services into serverless workflows. A **state machine** defines the sequence of steps (or states) to execute tasks such as invoking Lambda functions, waiting for user input, or handling retries and errors. These workflows are defined using JSON in the **Amazon States Language**.

### 2. **AWS Lambda**
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. Lambda functions are used to execute code in response to triggers, such as changes in an S3 bucket or transitions in a state machine.

### 3. **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**
Amazon S3 provides secure, scalable, and durable storage for any amount of data. It is often used to store files or logs generated by workflows or consumed by Lambda functions.

### 4. **IAM Roles and Policies**
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) allows you to securely manage access to AWS resources. Roles and policies define **who** can do **what** on **which resources**:
- **IAM Roles**: Used by services (like Lambda or EC2) to assume permissions.
- **IAM Policies**: JSON documents that define the permissions granted to users, groups, or roles.

### 5. **Execution JSON Files**
These JSON files define inputs, outputs, and parameters for workflows, making it easy to customize the behavior of state machines and their components without modifying code.

### 6. **Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)**  
Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) are pre-configured templates used to launch virtual machines (EC2 instances). An AMI includes the operating system, application software, and settings required for your environment.  
- **Public AMIs**: Available to all AWS users and often include popular OS distributions.  
- **Private AMIs**: Customized AMIs created by you or shared within your AWS account.  
- **Benefits**: Using AMIs ensures consistent environments across multiple instances and simplifies the deployment of pre-configured servers.

## Understanding AWS Pricing

AWS operates on a pay-as-you-go pricing model, meaning you only pay for the resources you use. Below is an overview of pricing for the services in this project:

- **AWS Step Functions**: Billed based on the number of state transitions in your workflows.
- **AWS Lambda**: Charged per request and for the compute time your function consumes (measured in milliseconds).
- **Amazon S3**: Pricing is based on the amount of data stored, requests made (e.g., uploads, downloads), and data transferred.
- **IAM Roles/Policies**: Provided at no additional cost, but they enable access to other billable resources.
- **Amazon EC2**:  
  - **Compute Time**: Billed per second or hour depending on the instance type.  
  - **Storage**: Charges apply for attached volumes (e.g., EBS).  
  - **Data Ingress**: Free for most data uploaded to AWS.  
  - **Data Egress**: Charged based on the amount of data transferred out of AWS to the internet or other regions. 
  - **Other Costs**: Elastic IP addresses and data transfer between availability zones may also contribute to costs.  


### AWS Pricing Tools
To estimate and manage costs effectively:
- Use the [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/)
- Set up [AWS Budgets](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-budgets/) to monitor usage and spending
- Review the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) for services with free usage limits

## Next Steps
Before diving into the infrastructure setup, ensure you:
- Have an AWS account with permissions to create the above resources.
- Familiarize yourself with the basics of JSON syntax (used for defining workflows and policies).
- Install the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) for managing resources programmatically.
