This folder contains the exact deployment of the research datastream in AWS. This is essentiallty a copy of `ngen-datastream/research_datastream/terraform`, with the addition of Amazon Event Bridge schedules added to `main.tf`. This drectory is separate because this terraform will incur charges if built! It exists to make the AWS configuration public to the community, but is not intended to be recreated.
