## `ngen-datastream` Output Directory Structure
When the datastream is executed a folder of the structure below will be constructed at `DATA_DIR`
```
DATA-PATH/
│
├── datastream-metadata/
│
├── datastream-resources/
|
├── ngen-run/
```
Each folder is explained below

### `datastream-metadata/` 

Holds metadata about the `ngen-datastream` excution that allows for a relatively condensed view of how the execution was performed. 
Example directory:
```
datastream-metadata/
│
├── datastream.env
│
├── datastream_steps.txt
│
├── conf_datastream.json
│
├── conf_fp.json
|
├── conf_nwmurl.json
|
├── profile_fp.txt
|
├── profile.txt
|
├── filenamelist.txt
|
├── realization_datastream.json
|
├── realization_user.json
```
| File Type | Path in Metadata Directory | Description  |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| DATASTREAM CONFIGURATION FILE | datastream-metadata/datastream.env | `CONF_FILE` that can be provided directly to datastreamcli as an argument to reproduce the exact run. |
| DATASTREAM COMMAND STEPS | datastream-metadata/datastream_steps.txt | Text file that logs each command datastream executes. |
| DATASTREAM CONFIGURATION | datastream-metadata/conf_datastream.json | Holds metadata about the execution |
| FORCING PROCESSOR CONFIGURATION | datastream-metadata/conf_fp.json | Configuration file for forcingprocessor. See [here](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen-datastream/tree/main/forcingprocessor#example-confjson) |
| NWM URL CONFIGURATION | datastream-metadata/conf_nwmurl.json | Configuration file for nwmurl. See [here](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen-datastream/tree/main/forcingprocessor#nwm_file) | 
| PROFILE | datastream-metadata/profile_fp.txt | Datetime print statements that allow for profiling each step in forcingprocessor| 
| PROFILE | datastream-metadata/profile.txt | Datetime print statements that allow for profiling each step in datastream | 
| FILENAME LIST | datastream-metadata/filenamelist.txt | Local file paths or URLs to NWM forcings. Generated by [nwmurl](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/nwmurl). | 
| REALIZATION | datastream-metadata/realization_datastream.json | NextGen configuration file. See [here](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen-datastream/blob/main/configs/ngen/realization_cfe_sloth_pet_nom.json). DataStreamCLI can edit the user supplied realization. This is the realization file that is used for the NextGen execution. | 
| REALIZATION | datastream-metadata/realization.json | NextGen configuration file. See [here](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen-datastream/blob/main/configs/ngen/realization_cfe_sloth_pet_nom.json). DataStreamCLI can edit the user supplied realization. This is the exact copy of the user supplied realization file and may differ from the file used for the NextGen execution. | 

### `RESOURCE_DIR` (`datastream-resources/`)
`datastream-resources/` holds all the input data files required to perform the various computations `ngen-datastream` performs. This folder is not required as input, but will be a faster method for running ngen-datastream repeatedly over a given spatial or time domain.

Examples of the application of the resource directory:
1) Repeated executions. `ngen-datastream` will retrieve files (that are given as arguements) remotely, however this can take time depending on the networking between the data source and host. Storing these files locally in `RESOURCE_DIR` for repeated runs will save time and network bandwith. In addition, this saves on compute required to build input files from scratch.
2) Communicating runs. ngen-datastream versions everything in `DATA_DIR`, which means a single hash corresponds to a unique `RESOURCE_DIR`, which allows users to quickly identify potential differences between `ngen-datastream` input data.

#### Guide for building a `RESOURCE_DIR`
The easiest way to create a reusable resource directory is to execute `ngen-datastream` and save `DATA_DIR/datastream-resources` for later use. A user defined `RESOURCE_DIR` may take the form below. Only one file of each type is allowed (e.g. cannot have two geopackages or two realizations). Not every file is required. `ngen-datastream` will generate all required files by default, but will skip those steps if corresponding files exist in the resource directory.

| FORCINGS | ngen-forcings/*.nc |  | netcdf holding ngen forcings.   | *.nc (by default), *.tar.gz, *.csv, *.parquet |

### `ngen-run/` 
Running NextGen requires building a standard run directory complete with only the necessary files. The datastream constructs this automatically, but can be manually built as well. Below is an explanation of the standard. Reference for discussion of the standard [here](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/NGIAB-CloudInfra/pull/17). 

A NextGen run directory `ngen-run` is composed of three necessary subfolders `config, forcings, outputs` and an optional fourth subfolder `metadata`.

```
ngen-run/
│
├── config/
│
├── forcings/
│
├── lakeout/
|
├── metadata/
│
├── outputs/
│
├── restart/
```

The `ngen-run` directory contains the following subfolders:

- `config`:  model configuration files and hydrofabric configuration files. A deeper explanation [here](#configuration-directory-ngen-runconfig)
- `forcings`: catchment-level forcing timeseries files. These can be generated with the [forcingprocessor](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen-datastream/tree/main/forcingprocessor). Forcing files contain variables like wind speed, temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation.
- `lakeout`: for t-route 
- `metadata` is an optional subfolder. This is programmatically generated and it used within to ngen. Do not edit this folder.
- `outputs`: This is where ngen will place the output files.
- `restart`: For restart files
 
#### Configuration directory `ngen-run/config/`
This folder contains the NextGen realization file, which serves as the primary model configuration for the ngen framework. This file specifies which models to run and with which parameters, run parameters like date and time, and hydrofabric specifications.

Based on the models defined in the realization file, BMI configuration files may be required. For those models that require per-catchment configuration files, a folder will hold these files for each model in `ngen-run/config/cat-config`. See [here](https://github.com/CIROH-UA/ngen-datastream/blob/main/docs/NGEN_MODULES.md) for which models ngen-datastream supports automated BMI configuration file generation. See the directory structure convention below.
